# Project-and-Diss
Project and Dissertation for my MSc, Chat-bot with visual representation for student well-being. Will utilise Google Voice API, Android development, TensorFlow use in order to design an application for the BlueFrog Robotics Buddy Pro robot model. 
[Webpage for Buddy Pro](https://www.bluefrogrobotics.com/robot/)

This Project will be for my MSc in Artificial intelligence that I am attending in the University of Kent. The project started in January and will continue through to september, where my project and dissertation will be due.

To start my research into creating and understaning the process of development, I am reading the paper and critiquing: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7919664?casa_token=8elvD97S5zsAAAAA:N6wCb_6Lf8XKpc44-ZXuimOETW92j82ugQI5ZfY72esk9311aN5xUOZqYHtjIpTKmrIHiPw

## Buddy SDK and development tools

### TensorFlow

Open source Machine Learning library that handles many functions for creating and calculating the neural network being able to handle the internal hidden layers, this will be used to help the AI chatbot learn and allows streamlining of the functions that might take up more time.

### Android Studio

Folder: res/layout
XML files that describe the
layout of the UI of the
application.
These could be:
• Layout files for each activity.
• Layout files used for
dynamically adapting the
User Interface.


AndroidManifest.xml
XML file with general
declarations about your
application, e.g.:
• Which version of Android it
runs on.
• What security permissions
it requires.
• What activities or services it
consists of
Declares components
• Names required libraries
• Lists permissions required
• Associates components with intents
• Says how each intent should be invoked (e.g. by
the Launcher)
• Specifies icons and labels for display to the user




### Buddy Pro SDK



### Android Debug Bridge

The connection between the OS and the Buddy pro is handled through ADB in android studio. The server will be set up in the testing area and will be run on the same device as the client. The Buddy pro will be the Daemon (adbd) in this scenario.

#### quick code test

```Python
a = "Hello World!"
print("a")
```


## Project Plan (rough at the moment)

### June:
Research into Buddy Pro SDK,
Learn Android Studio,
Research and learn TensorFlow functions to support the learning process,
Resarch how to integrate the Buddy Pro SDK into the project for robot functionality.
Keep Github updated

### July:
Have Android studio app functional by middle of July (potentially have robot already talking)
Have the Robot running correctly and fully functioning by the end of the month
Keep Github updated
Keep meetups

### August:
Plan the structure of the dissertation,
Start Dissertation using sources from Github,
Be finished before the end of the month.



## Project Design

### Objectives.
Robot will start to personalise people based off stuff like favourite food, place, hobbies.

Experiements for the thesis, create an interaction with robot.

Objectives of what I want to implement
e.g.

Robot being able to start a conversation.
